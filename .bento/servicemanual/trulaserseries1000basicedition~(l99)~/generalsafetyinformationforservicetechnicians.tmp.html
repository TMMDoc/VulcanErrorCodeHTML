<p>Many service activities can be dangerous.
Fundamental safety information and conduct guidelines are presented below and are not listed again separately in the instructions.
Generally speaking:
* Comply with the Safety chapter of the operator&#8217;s manual.
* Prohibition and warning signs on the machine as well as the warnings in the operator&#8217;s manual and in the instructions alsoapply to the service engineer.
* Comply with safety and warning instructions even when under time pressure.
* The service engineer has the function of a role model with respect to the customer and must act accordingly.
* When working on a machine with a customer or a second service engineer, ensure that you communicate clearly and make unambiguous arrangements.
Training course
* This service documentation is not intended for self-study. Participation in the corresponding product training course is required for service activities.
* All service engineers must attend an occupational safety training course for service engineers once a year.
If no safe alternative is available, the four-eyes principle must be applied before performing dangerous service activities.
Four-eyes principle for
dangerous activities
In doing so, the planned action steps must be checked and approved by another qualified person (e.g. in-house service engineer).
The information sheet on the four-eyes principle is part of the "Safety for service engineers" training and is available in SIS.

<strong>Uncontrolled machine action.</strong>
* Only put guards out of operation if the service operation cannot be performed otherwise.
* Make a note of all interventions in safety equipment before operation.
* Compensate for missing protective functions with additional measures.
* Restore and check protective function after end of operation.
Persons in the danger
All persons must be outside the machine&#8217;s danger zone when drives are active. Wherever possible, perform troubleshooting and diagnostics from outside the danger zone (remote support).
If it is absolutely necessary to enter in the danger zone, observe the following warnings.</p>

The customer&#8217;s assistance is needed for some service work.
Customer assistance
The customer cannot be expected to operate the machine safely during service work.
Make sure the customer is outside the danger zone while service work is being performed.
* If possible, try not to rely on the customer&#8217;s assistance.
* Do not encourage the customer to perform unauthorized activities.
* If necessary, request a second service engineer or request support from the In-house Sales / Service (remote support).
