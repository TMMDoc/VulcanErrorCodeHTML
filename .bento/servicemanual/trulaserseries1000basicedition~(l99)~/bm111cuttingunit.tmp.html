* Collimating module: Collimating the incident laser into a parallel beam and adjusting the beam spot from the center of the nozzle.
* Focusing driver module: The collimating beam is focused into a small beam spot which has high power density, and the focus position is adjusted by driving motor automatically.
* Protective lens module: The protective lens protects the focusing lens from contamination by the returning slag and extends the service life of the focusing lens.
* Nozzle module: Guide the focusing beam to the work piece and produce high velocity jet to achieve high quality cutting.
