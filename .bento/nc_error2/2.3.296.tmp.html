<p>The controller cannot evaluate the programmed axis, i.e. it is either incorrectly configured or not programmed at all, or assigned to the wrong NC channel.Possible causes:
 Axis was programmed incorrectly, e.g. x was programmed instead of X
 Axis is not configured at all or is configured incorrectly  ? Check machine constants? Is the axis letter assigned to the correct axis? ? Does the axis have an axis letter?
 Axis is assigned to the wrong channel (axis is to be moved in channel 0, but is assigned to channel 1)
 Axis is configured as handwheel, measuring axis and/or spindle and cannot execute the single block / DIN command</p>
